## ü§î What is UNO?

UNO is a timeless card game that has stood the test of time, delighting players of all ages and skill levels for decades. The objective of the game is to be the first player to empty your hand of cards by matching them with the card on the top of the discard pile, either by color or number. However, beware of the special action cards that can throw a wrench in your plans and completely change the course of the game! These cards include skips, reverses, draw twos, and the infamous color-changing wild and draw four wild cards. With every turn, the game becomes more and more exciting, as you try to outwit your opponents and emerge victorious!
